A Brief Introduction
====================
Cerulean Framework is an extremely versatile HTML5 WordPress framework based on ZURB's [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), a powerful tool for building prototypes on any kind of devices. Cerulean follows [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) standard and is [hNews microformat](https://www.readability.com/publishers/guidelines) ready. It is optimized for Search Engine while at the same time improves readability.

It is extremely easy to create your blog, CMS, brochure and any other kind of sites with Cerulean. You can see some [samples](http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.php) on ZURB and how they make these prototypes. Did I just mention Cerulean works well with [bbPress 2.0](http://bbpress.org/) and [BuddyPress 1.5](http://buddypress.org/)?
